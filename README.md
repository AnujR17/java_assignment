The question list are below: 

1.Write a program create a class ‘simpleobject‘. Using constructor display the message.

2.Write a program for the following 1. Example for call by value. 2. Example for call by reference.

3.Write a program to give the example for ‘this’ operator. And also use the ‘this’ keyword as return statement.

4.Create class named as ‘a’ and create a sub class ‘b’. Which is extends from class ‘a’. And use these classes in ‘inherit’ class.

5.Write a program to give the example for method overriding concepts.

6.Write a program to give the example for ‘super’ keyword.

7.Write a program to create a class named shape. In this class we have three sub classes circle, triangle and square each class has two member function named draw () and erase (). Create these using polymorphism concepts.

8.Write a program to give a simple example for abstract class.

9.Write a program suppose, it is required to build a project consisting of a number of classes, possibly using a large number of programmers. It is necessary to make sure that every class from which all other classes in the project will be inherited. Since any new classes in the project must inherit from the base class, programmers are not free to create a different interface. Therefore, it can be guaranteed that all the classes in the project will respond to the same debugging commands.

10.Write a program to create interface A in this interface we have two method meth1 and meth2. Implements this interface in another class named MyClass.

11.Write a program to give example for multiple inheritance in Java.

12.Write a program to create interface named test. In this interface the member function is square. Implement this interface in arithmetic class. Create one new class called ToTestInt in this class use the object of arithmetic class.

13.Create an outer class with a function display, again create another class inside the outer class named inner with a function called display and call the two functions in the main class.

14.Write a class called ColourChecking. Define a color with red = 193, green =255 and blue = 183. No separate the rgb values. Find the Hue, saturation and brightness of this color.

15.Write a program to check the font class method as follows: Create a font TimesRoman bold and Italic size 12. In this object use the font methods. Then display the attributes of the font.

16.Create class point with following instance variable and methods. 
Instance variable: private int x,y 
Constructors : public Point(), Point(int x, int y) 
Methods : public void setX(int x), setY(int y), setXY(int x, int y)

17.Create class Number with only one private instance variable as a double primitive type. To include the following methods (include respective constructors) isZero( ), isPositive(), isNegative( ), isOdd( ), isEven( ), isPrime(), isAmstrong() the above methods return boolean primitive type. getFactorial(), getSqrt(), getSqr(), sumDigits(), getReverse() the above methods return double primitive type. void listFactor(), void dispBinary().

18.Write a program to create a package named mypack and import it in circle class.

19.Create class box and box3d. box3d is extended class of box. The above two classes going to pull fill following requirement
Include constructor. set value of length, breadth, height Find out area and volume.
Note: Base class and sub classes have respective methods and instance variables.
